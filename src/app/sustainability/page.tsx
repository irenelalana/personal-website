              <h2>OUR COMMITMENT: SUSTAINABILITY AND NET ZERO INTENT</h2>
              <p>
                At Irela Aqua and Fitness, we believe that a healthy body and a healthy planet go hand-in-hand. 
                Our goal is to promote fitness in a way that is environmentally responsible, supporting our local community 
                and striving towards a minimal carbon footprint. Our "Net Zero Intent" outlines our dedication to sustainable 
                practices, reducing our environmental impact, and setting the standard for eco-conscious fitness.
              </p>
              <h2>Core Sustainability Objectives for 2025/2026</h2>
              <p>
                Our sustainability goals are driven by four key areas: <strong>Resource-Efficient Operations, Reducing Travel & Emissions,
                Waste Reduction & Circularity, and Minimising Energy Consumption.</strong>

            <h2>1. Resource-Efficient Operations & Smart Space Usage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Asset-Light Business Model:</strong> We do not own a physical, permanent facility. 
                    This strategy eliminates the need for maintaining and operating a commercial building, drastically 
                    reducing the environmental footprint (energy, waste, resources) associated with long hours of building disuse.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flexible Space Utilisation:</strong> We maximise the use of existing resources by conducting sessions 
                    in parks, outdoor areas, and private client homes. When internal spaces are needed, we strictly rent spaces 
                    only for the necessary hours. This smart approach minimises the carbon and resource impact linked to 
                    underutilised real estate and construction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Resourceful Smart Fitness:</strong> In our Smart Fitness sessions, we champion the use of simple, 
                    everyday objects as training tools (cushions, chairs, poles, etc.) and utilise household containers 
                    (detergent, liquids) for customisable resistance loads. This practice encourages resourcefulness and 
                    avoids the consumption and manufacturing footprint of specialised equipment.
                </li>
            </ul>
                

            <h2>2. Reducing Travel & Emissions (Digital Focus for 2026)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Online Swim Technique Correction (2026 Launch):</strong> By offering video-based, remote technique 
                    analysis, we eliminate the need for long-distance travel. This program saves clients significant fuel emissions 
                    and time by preventing long drives to a central pool for in-person correction sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>At-Home Aqua Fitness Program (2026 Launch):</strong> This digital program empowers clients to use 
                    the swimming facilities already available to them. It targets the vast number of underutilised private pools 
                    at homes, turning existing water resources into active fitness spaces and ensuring water is used effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Localised Coaching:</strong> Our trainers primarily operate locally, promoting the use of public 
                    transport, cycling, or walking. This commitment to local business severely limits the need for motorised 
                    vehicle travel related to coaching services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sustainable Travel Advocacy:</strong> We actively encourage an active lifestyle that starts outside 
                    the gym. We promote and offer guidance on using public transport, cycling (including beginner cycle lessons), 
                    and walking as the primary modes of transportation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>3. Waste Reduction & Circularity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Current Paperless Operations:</strong> All administrative and client paperwork is currently handled 
                    100% digitally. We operate without paper for bookings, forms, and client records.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Goal: Paperless Marketing by 2026:</strong> We commit to extending our paperless policy to all 
                    marketing and promotional materials by 2026, transitioning to exclusively digital outreach and advertising 
                    to minimise forestry impact.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reusable Client Gifts:</strong> To significantly reduce the need for single-use items, we exclusively 
                    offer reusable loyalty gifts, such as high-quality thermo bottles and quick-dry towels. This effort actively 
                    replaces disposables and promotes long-term use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Zero-Plastic Events:</strong> All Irela Aqua and Fitness events and workshops are strictly plastic-free, 
                    from food packaging to any materials used. We partner with suppliers committed to this standard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shared Pool Equipment:</strong> We operate a “share and care” system for all pool and fitness materials 
                    to actively combat consumerism. We maintain and share equipment to maximise its lifespan and minimise unnecessary 
                    purchasing.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Minimising Energy Consumption & Sustainable Lifestyles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Energy-Conscious Training:</strong> We deliberately structure our functional and aqua fitness programs 
                    to avoid reliance on motorised cardiovascular machines, significantly reducing our electricity use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ambient Temperature Training:</strong> We maximise the use of natural light and ambient temperatures 
                    in our sessions. By training without excessive heating or air conditioning, we drastically minimise energy usage 
                    and help clients acclimate their bodies to natural environmental conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Business Partnerships:</strong> We partner exclusively with local businesses for supplies, 
                    services, and event catering. This commitment shortens supply chains, supports the local economy, and avoids 
                    the significant environmental impact of mass transportation and logistics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Healthy & Sustainable Nutrition:</strong> Our event catering features healthy lunches and snacks that 
                    are exclusively home-cooked and prepared with fresh ingredients. We actively encourage clients to avoid 
                    pre-packaged foods—which are often high in toxic substances and heavily reliant on plastic packaging—promoting 
                    both health and waste reduction.
                </li>
            </ul>
  
              <h2>Moving Forward: Our Net Zero Horizon</h2>
              <p>
                Our commitment is continuous. We are constantly reviewing our operations to identify areas for improvement. 
                Our long-term intent includes:

              <ul>
                <li>Measuring our footprint: Working towards accurately tracking our energy use and carbon emissions to set concrete reduction targets.</li>
                <li>Advocating for Change: Using our platform to educate and inspire our clients and partners to adopt more sustainable practices in their own lives.</li>
              </ul>
