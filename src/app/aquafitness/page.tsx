<h1>AQUAFITNESS - AQUAEROBICS - AQUAGYM - Low-Impact, High-Results Training in the Water</h1>
  <h2>What it is:</h2>
  <p>
    Our <strong>Aquafitness Program</strong> delivers a fun, energising, and joint-friendly workout 
    in the pool. Combining cardio, strength, and mobility exercises, water resistance 
    makes every movement more effective while reducing stress on your joints.
  </p>
  <h2>Who it’s for:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Adults over 30 looking for a safe and enjoyable way to stay fit.</li>
    <li>Anyone managing joint pain, arthritis, or recovering from injury.</li>
    <li>People wanting a low-impact alternative to gym workouts.</li>
    <li>Beginner swimmiers or returning exercisers who want a supportive environment and gain confidence.</li>
  </ul>  

  <h2>What results you’ll get:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved cardiovascular health, endurance and stamina.</li>
    <li>Increased strength and muscle tone without heavy weights.</li>
    <li>Better flexibility, mobility, coordination, agility and balance.</li>
    <li>Reduced impact on joints, with less pain and stiffness.</li>
    <li>A fun, social environment that keeps you motivated.</li>
    <li>Reduced blood pressure and mitigate stress.</li>
  </ul>  

  <h2>Why now:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Because you don´t want more pain and impact on your joints and water-based workouts protect your joints while building strength and endurance</li>
    <li>Because we have all year outdoor heated pools (33 degrees), and... we want to be fit and tanned for the summer season which is around the corner</li>
    <li>Because regular aquafitness reduces long-term risk of mobility loss and stiffness</li>
    <li>Because it’s a safe, welcoming option if you’ve struggled with traditional gyms</li>
    <li>Research shows that water-based activities have a more positive effect on your mood and stamina, and are more effective at reducing stress and depression, than many other forms of exercise.</li>
  </ul>
