            <p> Welcome to Irela Aqua & Fitness, your ultimate partner in achieving your fitness and health goals! </p> 
            <p> My name is Irene Lalana. With a background as a professional swimmer and rescuer, I bring a unique set of skills and experience to the table, including a goal-driven mindset, responsibility, and organization.</p>
            <p> But you may still be wondering why you should choose me. Well, I am not just another coach. I am a Certified Fitness and Swimming coach, holding a degree in Sport Science, along with European and Australian recognition of all Fitness and Swimming qualifications required to coach you. With over 20 years of experience, I have successfully led diverse groups of people, each with their unique needs and goals. I am not only exceptionally organized and committed but also highly flexible, adapting to different client requirements without compromising the unity of the team.</p>
            <p> My over 20 years of experience have included roles as a coach, manager, and instructor in various sports, different levels, clubs, and organizations. I have grown and specialized in working with Women over 40, understanding their changing needs, bodies, and feelings, and promoting their wellness through an active lifestyle. The physical and emotional symptoms related to the changes in your hormone levels are very real and can be addressed to make you strong and resilient.</p>
            <p> Whether you're looking for guidance in losing weight, learning to swim, planning your routine, or simply improving your overall health and well-being, I am fully dedicated to your success.</p>
            <p> Moreover, what sets me apart is that I may be the only one offering comprehensive wellness programs that combine fitness and aqua-swimming in Brisbane, both in Spanish and English!</p>
            <p> Thank you for visiting my website and Social Media. I look forward to starting our fitness & swimming journey together soon!</p>
