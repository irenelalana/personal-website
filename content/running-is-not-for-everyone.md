People who don’t usually exercise often say *“I hate running”*.

Truth be told… many people who **do** exercise say the same thing.

Excuses are one of the biggest daily battles sports professionals face: *“I don’t have time”*, *“it’s too expensive”*, *“work”*, *“family”*, which eventually lead to *“I’m tired”* or *“I don’t feel like it”*.  

In reality, these are just excuses. If those people who claim to hate running worked with a **qualified trainer**, they would soon realise two things:

1. You don’t need to run to be fit  
2. Ideally, you should be fit **before** deciding whether running is right for you

## Exercise Is More Than Running

To anyone living a sedentary lifestyle, I’d encourage you to explore the huge variety of physical activities available today. There are countless sports and exercise options adapted to different fitness levels and goals — **without running at all**.

Once again, no one is better suited to guide you than a **certified fitness professional**, who can tailor recommendations to your personal needs and characteristics.

So why does it seem like *sport* equals *running*?

Call it sport, call it exercise — **but do it** 🙂

## My Personal Experience

I’m 37 years old and I’ve been physically active since I learned how to walk. I’ve run, swum, rowed, cycled, danced, climbed, hiked, skated and skied.

In fact, I stopped running two years ago due to injuries — and I’m still just as active as I was before.

And let’s not forget: gym classes, team sports, racket sports, combat sports, rhythmic activities… the list is endless. All of these are exercise too.

## Is It Bad If You Don’t Like Running?

Absolutely **not**.

Unfortunately, trends and media strongly influence us. From childhood, many of us are pushed toward a limited set of sports, which prevents us from discovering the wide range of individual and group activities available today — indoors or outdoors, competitive or recreational — all with enormous health benefits.

Even worse, it’s common to see people running with excess weight and very poor technique.

## When Should You NOT Run?

Always follow **medical advice**. If you have a condition or injury where running is contraindicated, you shouldn’t do it.

Once your doctor gives you the green light, it’s essential to work with a **qualified professional in Physical Activity and Sports Sciences**, who can supervise technique and ensure a proper progression of training loads.

This is equally important if:
- You’ve never run before
- You’re returning after a long inactive period

Many injuries occur during the return to exercise because joints aren’t ready for impact, muscles lack adaptation, mobility is limited, or footwear is inappropriate.

Regular medical check-ups that assess your current physical condition are also highly recommended.

## Risks of Running Without Guidance

The most common issues include:
- Muscle injuries  
- Joint pain  
- Overuse injuries caused by poor technique  

Without professional planning that controls training load (distance, intensity, recovery), the body may fail to adapt:

- **Too much** → excessive heart rate, muscular stress, injuries  
- **Too little** → boredom, lack of motivation  

In both cases, abandonment is very likely.

## Reasonable Alternatives to Running

Today, there are countless alternatives both inside and outside fitness centres.

During lockdowns, for example, we saw how much exercise can be done at home with little or no equipment thanks to online coaching, live classes, tutorials and technique progressions.

A word of caution: always check the **qualifications** of any online trainer you follow.

## Choosing the Right Activity Depends on Your Goal

Some people run simply because they enjoy it — to clear their minds with a simple aerobic activity. If they need to stop for health reasons, alternatives like cycling, swimming, rowing, skating, cross-country skiing or **Nordic walking** are often recommended.

Nordic walking, in particular, is growing rapidly thanks to its joint-friendly, low-impact nature and effectiveness for all fitness levels.

👉 Regardless of the activity, combining aerobic exercise with **at least one weekly strength or conditioning session** is strongly recommended to prevent injuries and improve overall performance.

## Running for Weight Loss or Fitness

If your goal is weight loss or general fitness, research clearly shows that combining **aerobic exercise with strength training** is the most effective approach.

And no — strength training does **not** mean lifting heavy weights like in old-school gyms 😉

Concepts such as *functional training*, *cross training* or *circuit training* simply aim to improve:
- Strength
- Endurance
- Coordination
- Mobility
- Agility

All of this leads to a more **functional body**, which ultimately improves quality of life.

## And If Your Goal Is Competition?

It depends on age, training history and physical wear. Often, goals can be adapted:
- Competing in other disciplines
- Discovering healthier, lesser-known sports like rowing or Nordic walking

And here’s a final secret, from personal experience:

**You can also retire from competition — and that’s perfectly fine 🙂**
