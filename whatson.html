            <p>A morning dedicated to celebrate the strength, resilience, and beauty of womanhood. This workshop is not just a gathering but a powerful opportunity to connect with other women, share our stories, and honor both our vulnerability and our strength.<p/>
          <p> Together, we’ll create a nurturing space filled with food for the body, mind, heart, and creative spirit, leaving you feeling nourished, refreshed, and energized.<p/>
          <p>Through guided activities, thoughtful discussions, and shared experiences, we’ll explore what empowers us as women and discover practical ways to bring this empowerment into our daily lives. You'll leave with new habits and insights to support your well-being and personal growth long after the workshop ends.<p/>
          <p>This is a time to honor yourself—to step into a space of self-discovery, self-care, and connection, knowing that the collective energy of women coming together can be truly transformative.<p/>
